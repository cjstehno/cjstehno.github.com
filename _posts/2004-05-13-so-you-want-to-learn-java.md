A friend of mine is a Windows developer and he wants to learn Java, which is why this is all geared towards a Windows user, that is what we both use; however, most of the information is the same across most platforms. I told him that I’d help him get started with some practical quick start tips. I decided to solidify them for posterity:

<ul>
<li>Download and install the Java 2 Standard Edition Software Development Kit (J2SE SDK) version 1.5 (or whatever the most current is) from Sun <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html">Java 1.4.2 Download</a>.</li>
<li>Don’t start by jumping right into using an IDE, you will gain a much better grasp of the language if you use a simple text editor like Notepad or <a href="http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net">Notepad++</a> and the Java command line tools (found in the bin directory of your Java installation).</li>
<li>Get a strong understanding of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%20Oriented%20Programming">Object Oriented Programming</a> — it is one of the most important foundations of development in Java and it will reward you greatly if you continue on with Java.</li>
<li>There is a wealth of learning materials online. I would recommend going through the main set of tutorials on Sun’s <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial">Java Language Totorial</a> page and then step back and look at <a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/onlineTraining/index.html">other tutorials</a> that Sun offers (all are free of course).</li>
<li>The JavaDocs for the J2SE API are one of your best friends while learning Java and even after you have mastered it. The compiled JavaDocs do not come with the installation, but they can be downloaded here: <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html</a>. They provide documentation for every method of every class in the core API. Read them, know them, live them.</li>
<li>There are a lot of forums and help sites out there too, look around (or come here and email me a question)</li> 
<li>One of the best ways to learn about how something is done in Java is to download some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSource">OpenSource</a> code and see how it does what it does. That is one of the beauties of OpenSource. Apache’s <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/">Jakarta Project</a> has code libraries to do pretty much anything you want, and most of it is well-written and documented.</li>
<li>Once you have gotten good with your text editor and command line tools and have written a few simple applications, download one of the popular Java IDEs, such as <a href="http://eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> or <a href="http://netbeans.org">NetBeans</a>. Don’t purchase an IDE, that’s just stupid, and in general, they are no better than the free ones.</li>
<ul>

Obviously, this is not an all inclusive list; however, if you follow these steps, you should get a good start into the Java language. Good luck!
