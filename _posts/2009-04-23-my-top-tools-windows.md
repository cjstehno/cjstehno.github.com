After reading list after list of top-ten this and that, I figured I would add my own to the pile. Here are my top ten most useful tools that I have found for every-day usage/development on Windows (some are available on other OSes too). I am excluding programming specific tools, such as <a href="http://eclipse.org">Eclipse</a>, and scripting languages such as <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org">Groovy</a> and <a href="http://ruby-lang.com">Ruby</a>... though of course I just mentioned all three.

In no particular order, even though they are numbered:

<ol>
<li><a href="http://launchy.net">Launchy</a> - quick application launcher; never search for an application again.</li>
<li><a href="http://openoffice.org">OpenOffice.org</a> - It's like MS Office, without the pain.</li>
<li><a href="http://7-zip.com">7-zip</a> - compress and decompress in various formats with a good UI.</li>
<li><a href="http://uvnc.com">UltraVnc</a> - excellent full-features VNC client and server.</li>
<li><a href="http://winmerge.org">Winmerge</a> - visual diff tool for windows.</li>
<li><a href="http://truecrype.org">TrueCrypt</a> - creates strongly encrypted filesystems with various algorithms available.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> - a must have since MS never saw fit to add real command line support to Windows.</li>
<li><a href="http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/">Notepad++</a> - great text (and code) editor with a lot of features.</li>
<li><a href="http://keepass.info/">KeePass</a> - you have to store all those passwords somewhere.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">Putty</a> - excellent network client.</li>
</ol>

Honorable mention - ok, there are a few more that I felt should have made the list, but just were not really in the top ten, so here are the honorable mentions:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://mozilla.com/firefox">Firefox</a> - simply the best browser; not on the list above because I really don't consider it a tool.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.fileshredder.org/">FileShredder</a> - good for keeping your drive clean of hidden personal data.</li>
<li><a href="http://cdexos.sourceforge.net/">CDex</a> - great tool for ripping CDs, though not really needed any more since I only buy MP3s.</li>
<li><a href="http://winscp.net">WinScp</a> - visual SCP client, because sometimes command line can be a pain in the butt.</li>
</ul>

Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that all of these are free. Enjoy!
