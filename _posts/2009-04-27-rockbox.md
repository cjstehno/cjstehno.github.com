My aging iPod Nano decided to stop shutting down the other day and the only "fix" I could find on-line was to reinstall the firmware from Apple. I am by no means a fan of Apple and I have never really been happy about having to install iTunes and various other pieces of software whenever my iPod gets homesick (i.e. decides it needs an update/re-installation). So I decided to take the plunge and install <a href="http://www.rockbox.org/">Rockbox</a> on my iPod to give it a try.

I kept running out of space because it does not delete the stuff already on the iPod. 

Now I have all the features of my iPod that I ever used (playing music) plus I can now play other formats, such as Ogg, I can now mount the iPod and simply transfer files to/from just like a normal drive - no more music loading plugins, iTunes, etc, and Rockbox is extensible so that if I want to change the skinning or add/remove applications, I can.

Rockbox may or may not have all the other iPod basic features, you will have to check to see if your favorites are in there, but I would be surprised if they were not. Rockbox has been around for a while and seems to have a very good development community behind it.

The screenshot to the left is of the main menu, something the web site seemed to be lacking any pictures of. The interface is very colorful, clean and functional. Oh yeah, it sounds great too. 

If for some reason you don't like Rockbox, you can uninstall it and then reinstall the Apple firmware with no leftovers or consequences.

Ah, the joys of free software.
