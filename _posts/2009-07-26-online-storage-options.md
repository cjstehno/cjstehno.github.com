I have been using <a href="http://mozy.com">Mozy Home</a> to do online backups for a little over a year now and it has been great, though I must admit, I have never needed to do more than restore one or two files at a time.

Mozy has been out of the way, doing its backups in the background or at times when the computer is otherwise idle, but it is missing one important feature, in my opinion... there is no Linux client. If you are using Linux all you have available is the web client, which is really just for management of your account and working with a few files at a time.

Also on the down side is that Mozy Home is not exactly cheap when you are using more than the free 2GB of storage, coming out to just over $59/year. It's unlimited storage, but it's a flat rate and you can only use it on one computer (which you can get around my mapping drives, but it's still a pain).

I started checking out some of the alternatives and came across a few good contenders, <a href="http://jungledisk.com">JungleDisk</a>, <a href="http://www.getdropbox.com">DropBox</a> and <a href="http://box.net">Box.net</a>.

I will admit that I have used DropBox in the past and found it very useful for transferring files between computers (work and home, etc); however, it too has a 2GB free limit and then you can upsell to either a 50GB or 100GB "premium" account, for $99/year and $199/year respectively. 

DropBox has a good interface (both cross-platform desktop client and web client) but it really feels more like the cloud version of a flash drive rather than a solid backup and storage tool. I would recommend using it for personal stuff under the 2GB limit, and I will continue to do so (it is free). They also provide some social tools like file sharing (public and private) of documents and photos.

Box.net right off the bat looks more like a collaboration tool for project teams (and to their credit, that is how they present it). It has a wealth of features and a good range of scaling options from a 1GB free account up to "mostly unlimited" Enterprise level account running $25/user/month, with a couple options in between. Box.net is very much geared towards business users and their needs... not really what I am looking for, but something to keep in mind.

The final option that I considered was JungleDisk. JungleDisk embraces the whole "cloud" concept that has come to the forefront of software development. With their storage you pay $2/month + storage fees, which you can get as low as $0.15/GB/month. That doesn't sound bad at all... but say you have 40GB that you want to backup:

<pre>($2 * 12 months) + (40GB * $0.15 * 12 months) = $96</pre>

Ouch! Considering I pay $59/year for unlimited storage with Mozy, that's pretty expensive. Granted you can use JungleDisk across all three platforms (on as many computers as you want) and it has a web interface. I may just have to bite the bullet and reduce my backup size down to the bare minimum and maybe diversify my storage across a few of the free options to keep cost down.
