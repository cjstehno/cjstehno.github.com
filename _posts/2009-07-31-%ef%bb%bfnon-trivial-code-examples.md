Something I am striving for with the postings here on CoffeaElectronica.com is the presentation of concepts using non-trivial examples. I find that a lot of the documentation, books and even blog posts out there present their content using some really simple example which makes the task seem deceptively easy, through no fault of the writer.

The problem is that it's no trivial task (pardon the pun) to create non-trivial and meaningful examples without either clouding the issue at hand or going off into some big project just to detail a small piece of it.
 I think what we (the blogging development community) need are a set of litmus tests for development. Of course, there is no one-size-fits-all solution, but a set of micro-projects that represent different aspects of development without being too complex. They should be the development equivalent of the "white rat" bred for testing and themselves benign and understandable without much fuss.

The "white rat" projects should be built around a specification, for cases when the development itself is being presented; however, there should also be a set of base implementations to provide a common starting point for other discussions, perhaps a Servlet / JSP implementation, one using Spring-MVC, and one using Struts. These generic starting points should provide the bare minimum implementation needed to get the job done without becoming an over-important part of the topic being discussed.

I used a simple email list Servlet example for my "<a href="http://coffeaelectronica.com/blog/?s=Tour+de+Mock">Tour de Mock</a>" series of postings and, in my opinion, that seemed to work quite well since all I really needed was some code to test that actually had a little functionality to it.

Perhaps this is something that will just have to be considered on a case by case basis with attention to providing more complex examples of functionality without losing track of what you are really trying to showcase.
 Something to keep in mind going forward.
