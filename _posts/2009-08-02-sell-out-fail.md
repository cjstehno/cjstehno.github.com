Wow, I can't even sell out if I try! I decided that I would look into putting Google AdSense advertisements on this site for a while, so I went through their sign-up procedure and after a couple days I got back an account rejection email:

<blockquote>
Hello Christopher,

Thank you for your interest in Google AdSense. Unfortunately, after
reviewing your application, we're unable to accept you into Google AdSense
at this time.

We did not approve your application for the reasons listed below.

Issues:

- Under construction

---------------------

Further detail:

Under construction: We've found that your site's pages are incomplete or
under construction. To be considered for AdSense, we require websites to
be fully launched and functioning, allowing users to navigate throughout
your site with a menu, sitemap, or appropriate links. Your site must also
contain enough content for our specialists to review and to display
relevant ads. Once the majority of your site is complete and functional,
we'll be happy to reconsider your application.
</blockquote>

Huh? I will admit that not ALL of my posts have been moved over to this new site, but this is as "complete" as it gets. Oh well, I guess I will have to just keep doing this for free... I will have to look into those donation and tip sites. Maybe I am worthy enough for one of those.
