The latest video in the "Charlie the Unicorn" saga is out and I heard that there were coworkers of mine who had never heard of Charlie so I gathered up the links to the official versions of all three:
<ol>
	<li> <a href="http://www.filmcow.com/charlietheunicorn.html">Charlie the Unicorn</a> - Charlie goes to the Candy Mountain Cave.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.filmcow.com/flash-charlietheunicorn2.html">Charlie the Unicorn 2</a> - Charlie finds the Banana King.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.filmcow.com/flash-charlietheunicorn3.html">Charlie the Unicorn 3</a> - Charlie finds out that sea creatures love you.</li>
</ol>
They are animated humor that is basically safe for work. I didn't really like "Charlie the Unicorn" the first time I saw it, but after I watched again I couldn't get it out of my head.

Enjoy!
