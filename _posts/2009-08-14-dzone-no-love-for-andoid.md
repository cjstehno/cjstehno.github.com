If you are following along, you know that I recently purchased the new T-Mobile Android phone, the myTouch (see "<a href="http://coffeaelectronica.com/blog/2009/08/android-love/">Android Love</a>"). I have started using it for my morning blog reading, which in general has been great, except that a lot of good links come by way of <a href="http://dzone.com">DZone.com</a> (a developer link aggregation and voting site)... why is this a problem? Well, their site is completely unusable on the Android web browser. You can't even find the link to the actual article as it doesn't seem to even be rendered. Ouch.

Being a good net-citizen and avid reader of DZone, I figured I would post some feedback about the oversight.

<blockquote>
I have loved DZone since way back at the beginnings when it was just Java/Eclipse-Lobby. The site is great, the concept and the content are great... one thing is missing that I recently was shocked to find out. The site is completely unusable on the Android browser. :-(

Are there any plans for a mobile version of the site or a specialized DZone Android App? If it's a need for developers, I would be happy to assist in either approach.

Keep up the great work!

DZone started out as a Java and Eclipse article and discussion site and has since morphed into a more broader scope; however, they still seem to be very heavily Java and related technology oriented. The response I got back a few hours later was a bit of a surprise:

<blockquote>
Chris,

At this point we dont have any plans for a website that is Android compatible. We are working on an iPhone app and possibly after that we could revisit the potential for something for Android.

Sorry about the inconvenience.

And with that the ticket was closed. Wow, ok, way to drink the Apple Juice. Would it be that hard to make a light-weight mobile (meaning iphone, android, winme, whatever) version of the site?

Any DZone-loving Android users out there care to help me out writing a DZone Reader App?
