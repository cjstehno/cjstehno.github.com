You may have noticed that I have added some advertising to this site. I had originally looked into putting AdSense ads on the site; however, after <a href="http://coffeaelectronica.com/blog/2009/08/sell-out-fail/">first rejecting me</a> and then finally accepting me, I found that their ads are very ugly and their management tools are pretty sub-par. So I took a look at Amazon's Affiliate program. The ads from Amazon are much more attractive and refined so they don't really bring down the look of the page. Also, their management and creation tools are flexible and easy to use.

I have never really liked advertising in general and felt for a long time that I would never use it on any of my sites; however, financial pressure can sometimes influence such opinions. The ads I have implements are out-of-the-way, on the lower-end of the side bar and down in the footer so as not to detract from the site content. I will also use product links in posts when I refer to a book or something.

Lastly, I do get money when you purchase something through one of the links/ads on this site. Actually, I would get Amazon gift certificates... so, it's really win-win for them. :-)

Thank you in advance for any purchases you make through my affiliations. 

If you represent a company and would like to advertise on this site, please feel free to contact me, though be advised that I will be <i>very</i> picky about what ads I would accept.

If you have any comments and/or complaints, you are free to email me at "<script type="text/javascript">document.write('chris');document.write(' at ');document.write('stehno.com');</script>".
