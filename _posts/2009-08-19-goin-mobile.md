[caption id="attachment_344" align="alignleft" width="200" caption="Mobile version of this site."]<a href="http://coffeaelectronica.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/site-snap.png"><img src="http://coffeaelectronica.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/site-snap-200x300.png" alt="Mobile version of this site." title="site-snap" width="200" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-344" /></a>[/caption]One of the things I have realized while browsing around the internet on a little tiny phone screen is that there are a lot of sites out there with little to no support for mobile devices.

Some sites are generally usable without much pain or tweaking, and some have special versions built specifically to support mobile devices, while there is another category that just does not work at all... I am looking at you DZone. I hate to poke that sore spot but it has been a real pain for me (and yes I am working on an app to take care of it).

In case you did not notice, the image to the left is a screenshot of this site's brand new mobile version. Okay, it's pretty weak, but it's usable. I will keep tweaking it and trying to make it better and more usable.

My <a href="http://android.com">Android</a> development time has been going well. I have written the first sputterings of an app; however, I am having trouble actually deploying it to the real device. I don't really want to setup a Marketplace account for a simple little personal application. I can't seem to figure out how to install an app directly via USB and doing it over the internet seems to have it's own issues. I will figure it out, it will just require some Google time. 

The actual development is quite interesting. It is has aspects of Eclipse RCP development and Google GWT development... just in the feel of how things are done and laid out. The declarative UI system is great and not too hard to use once you get the hang of it.
