This was going to be a top 10 list of my favorite Android applications; however, I could not easily narrow it down to ten at this point, so you get the top X (non-games):

<ol>
	<li>Astrid - multipurpose task manager.</li>
	<li>FBreader - ebook reader.</li>
	<li>Here I Am - plots out exactly where you are and allows you to send the location to others.</li>
	<li>Mixzing lite - music player with recommendations</li>
	<li>My Tracks - records your path with time, distance and elevation.</li>
	<li>PicSay - fun photo manipulation.</li>
	<li>Shazam - figures out what a song is from a small bit of it.</li>
	<li>Weather bug - weather app</li>
	<li>Where - a little bit of everything, food, weather, traffic, etc</li>
	<li>Any cut - allows more flexible home shortcuts.</li>
	<li>Barcode scanner - scan bar codes for links, text, etc</li>
	<li>Compare Everywhere - scan a barcode and find out how much and where you can get it.</li>
	<li>Listen - podcast search and recommendations</li>
	<li>Radio finder - finds your local am/fm radio stations.</li>
	<li>Shop Savvy - another barcode scanner comparison shopper app.</li>
	<li>Tip Calc - cool tip calculator and check divider</li>
</ol>

I also have some that I tried and did not really like:

<ul>
<li>Sherpa - not very user-friendly and never really seemed to find anything useful</li>
<li>last.fm - should be called crash.fm and it really only works on a wireless network.</li>
<li>linkedin - not really useful for more than accessing your contact information.</li>
<li>aCast - pod cast management does not really work well.</li>
</ul>
