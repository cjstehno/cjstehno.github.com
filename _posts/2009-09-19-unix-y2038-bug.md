Aparently there are still some short-sighted developer date-based issues out there, one of which is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem">Year 2038 Problem</a>, which is a unix-based problem with how the milliseconds since 1970 value is stored... it's a 32-bit value which will wrap around into negative numbers in 2038.

I ran a quick sanity check in Linux:

<code lang="java">Date expiration = new Date(Long.MAX_VALUE);</code>

and found that a Mac and Linux running Sun's JVM seems to be fine:

<pre>Sun Aug 17 01:12:55 CST 292278994</pre>

while GCJ on Linux produced:

<pre>
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: month out of range:-19461555
at gnu.java.util.ZoneInfo.getOffset(int, int, int, int, int, int) (/usr/lib/libgcj.so.5.0.0)

Ouch!

This is kind of a subtle issue since your JVM may be giving you the correct value; however, your database which may be running on Linux might give you the wrong value from a time-based operation (or an error).

This is one to keep an eye one.
