A while back I wrote a post about available <a href="http://coffeaelectronica.com/blog/2009/07/online-storage-options/">Online Storage Options</a> and their benefits and pricing. I have started looking into another option, <a href="http://spideroak.com">SpiderOak</a>; odd name, interesting product.

SpiderOak provides 2GB of free storage and then has a volume-based pricing plan from their. They also have a web interface, backup/sync clients for Windows, Mac, and Linux, personal file sharing "rooms", and all of their storage is by volume not by computer; you can have 20 computers using the same account as long as you are within your storage limit.

Their pricing is simple, either $10/100GB/month, or $100/100GB/year, which for my 40GB calculation in the other posting would put me at either $120 or $100 per year for 40GB of storage across all computers. I dont even have 100GB of stuff to store right now.

Granted $100/year is a bit more than I really want to spend (though only slightly more than what I was looking at through Jungle Disk), but the multi-computer aspect and cross-platform support are very appealing.
