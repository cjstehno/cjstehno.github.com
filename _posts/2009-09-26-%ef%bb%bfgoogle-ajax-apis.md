I came across the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxlibs/">Google Hosted Ajax Libraries</a> recently and have since found them to be quite useful, especially in quick testing situations where you really don't want to have to setup a project. You can do everything in one nice text file.



To use the library you want, simply link to it using the external script source link:



<code lang="html">

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.3.2/jquery.min.js"></script>

</code>



Google has them hosted, minimized and cached so they are nice and fast. Pretty handy.



I mentioned this quickly in my post about <a href="http://coffeaelectronica.com/blog/2009/09/highlight-text-with-javascript/">Highlighting Text With JavaScript</a>, but I felt that it needed its own little post so that it doesn't get lost.
