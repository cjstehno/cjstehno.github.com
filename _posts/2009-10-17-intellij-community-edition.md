The big IDE news recently was that the often touted <a href="http://jetbrains.com">IntelliJ</a> now has an OpenSource <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/nextversion/free_java_ide.html">Community Edition</a>... and that has all it's rabid fans predicting the total downfall of <a href="http://eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> and <a href="http://netbeans.org">NetBeans</a>. Uh... did anybody actually <em>look</em> at what they offer in the free edition? If you look at their <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/nextversion/editions_comparison_matrix.html">feature comparison chart</a>, you can see that for free you can get a glorified text editor... way to go!

Proponents of IntelliJ always complain about how you have to install a lot of plug-ins with Eclipse and NetBeans in order to match the built-in features of their IDE. Well, now with the Community Edition you not only don't get that functionality, but you can't even add it with plug-ins. Bravo! It reminds me a little of Visual Studio and their Educational Edition with most of the really necessary features disabled until you shell out the cash.
