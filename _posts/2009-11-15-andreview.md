I am going to start doing more formal reviews of the Android apps that I use or have tested. I will describe each app and delve into its benefits and drawbacks based on three main criteria: usability, functionality and stability which will each be given a rating of 1 to 5. At the end of the rewiew I will summarize with an average score as well as an overall rating for the app; the overall rating will be based on the average of the other three scores with a bump up or down (+/-1) based on my overall feeling of the app. This overall score gives me a little leeway for times when the average may not really reflect the actual feeling of the app (for better or worse).

<dl>
    <dt>Usability</dt>
    <dd>The ease of use and how the user-needs are met in a simple straight-forward manner.</dd>
    
    <dt>Functionality</dt>
    <dd>Does the app do what you would expect for an app of its type?</dd>
    
    <dt>Stability</dt>
    <dd>How often does the app crash, if ever? How peppy is it?</dd>
</dl>

At the bottom of each review I will add a simple score card with additional information about the app. It will look basically like this:

    <div><a href="http://someappsite.com" title="http://someappsite.com">Some App</a> (price) - <span title="Usability"><b>U:</b>3</span>, <span title="Functionality"><b>F:</b>3</span>, <span title="Stability"><b>S:</b>3</span>, <span title="Overall"><b>O:</b>3</span></div>

If you have an app that you would like me to try out and review, please feel free to let me know.
