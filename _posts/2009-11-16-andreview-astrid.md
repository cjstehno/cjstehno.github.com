I am going to start off a new series of postings called <a href="">Andreview</a> by reviewing <a href="http://weloveastrid.com/">Astrid</a>. Astrid is a simple task manager with priorities, tags, reminders, and alerts.

<strong>Usability (4)</strong>

Astrid is very easy to use. It has a simple straight-forward interface based on lists of tasks that can be filtered by tag or other criteria. It also provides calendar integration for scheduling tasks as well as easy task creation options.

<strong>Functionality (4)</strong>

Astrid is all about task management. It is generally responsive and does what you expect from a task manager. It will also sync up with your <a href="http://rememberthemilk.com">Remember The Milk</a> tasks, if you have an account. The only piece of functionality that I think would make Astrid better would be some sort of desktop or web-based client so that Astrid could better integrate with other systems. The RTM integration is nice, but an Astrid-specific application would be better.

<strong>Stability (4)</strong>

To my recollection after having used Astrid for a couple months now, I have never had it crash. It does currently have an annoying bug that is causing me problems right now, but I may join in with the effort to fix it (basically you can't get a view of all tasks from the widget).

<strong>Overall (4)</strong>

Overall I think Astrid is the best task-manager I have seen for the Android OS. It's clean, fast and simple. Also, baring the one bug I have run into, it's stable and responsive.
