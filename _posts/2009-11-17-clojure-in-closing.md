After reading the book, "<a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/shcloj/programming-clojure">Programming Clojure</a>" by Stuart Halloway, I think that I have run out of parenthesis. All kidding aside, <a href="http://clojure.org">Clojure</a> seems like a very powerful and flexible language, if you can get a hand around it. The basic concepts are fairly straight-forward; however, as I got deeper into it I found it difficult to keep track of my location in the code and quickly lost sight of what was going on. I attribute this to a few things, one being the drastic syntactical difference between Clojure and other languages I have worked with (Java, Groovy, Ruby, Perl, etc), another is the functional programming aspect. The functional programming was tough to work around for me, having been "born" an object oriented imperative developer. I kept wanting to stuff things in variables. I would recommend Clojure to someone with more of a function programming or Lisp programming background, for whom it would be a great transition into the JVM.

I will keep an eye on it, and maybe come back to it later; however, I don't see it becoming one of my go-to languages, as it requires too much of a paradigm shift for me to be able to produce any code with it. If I needed to use it on a regular basis, I am sure that I would catch on and probably even come to enjoy it (there are a lot of great features in Clojure), but for now it will just be an educational diversion.

If you are a curly-brace developer and looking for a real change of scenery, give Clojure a try.
