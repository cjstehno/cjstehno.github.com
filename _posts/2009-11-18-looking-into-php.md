I have started to look into <a href="http://php.net">PHP</a> a bit. I have a general working-knowledge of it's language, which seems to be the point at which most "developers" start to call themselves PHP developers or programmers. I have nothing against PHP; however, I have seen a lot of good money spent on bad PHP code and coders that have no idea how to write good software. It's not the language, it's the coders. But, I digress.

So, trying not to join that group, I decided to find out what "best practices", unit testing functionality and other standards exist around PHP. I came across some helpful postings.

	<li><a href="http://www.phpunit.de/">PhpUnit</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.simpletest.org/">SimpleTest</a></li>
</ul>

I am happy to see that there is unit testing support, and that is seems to be very standard xUnit-style; there even seems to be some support for mock objects.

There are quite a few web development frameworks for PHP, which is good; I will have to dig up a handful of them and see what they provide.

There is also decent IDE support, including an Eclipse plug-in (<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/pdt/">PDT</a>).

Not sure where I will go from here, maybe put together a working project to try things out in a few real-world situations.
