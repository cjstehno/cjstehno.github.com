Okay, so, it's not really all that useful or exciting, but it was a good learning experience and it does provide a nice way to interact with this site (I have a few additional features I want to add in). Since I know you are in a hurry to download and install this little beauty, you can go over to my new <a href="mobile">Mobile</a> page for more information.

I am not going to try and put this app on the official Android market, since it really has very limited use. Also, for now, the app is closed source. I need to clean it up a bit and get a little better with Android development before I share. ;-)

Basically all it does at this point is provide a nice reading experience for reading my posts on an Android phone. You can also click the menu button which provides a "contact me" button and a "go to site" option, both doing what you would expect.

Currently it works on phones running Android 1.6, I have not tried it under 2.0 yet.
