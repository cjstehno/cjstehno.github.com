I have been consolidating all of my personal projects and prototypes trying to get everything setup on <a href="http://gitscm.org">Git</a> and <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>. I have used <a href="http://sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a> for years, but have lately found their project management model a bit on the heavy side. I have really taking a liking to Git for my personal projects, so GitHub was an easy choice. GitHub provides good Git integration with lightweight wiki and bug-tracking as well as some other handy features like code archive downloading.

I have most of my projects converted over, though most of them will be going through some refactoring soon (package names, testing, personal code reviews, etc) so that they are all brought up to at least some minimum level of quality. I will also need to update some of my archived blog posts so that they point to the correct project repositories.

In general, I don't think anybody else really cares about most of this stuff, but there is some useful code in there among the fluff and flair. There are a number of prototype and proof-of-concept type projects in there that I am not sure even work any more... so, I have some work to do. :-)

My GitHub Dashboard is located at: <a href="http://github.com/cjstehno">http://github.com/cjstehno</a>, just be warned, currently all of the code is in a state of flux.

Enjoy!
