I would say that maybe they are waiting until they sell a certain number of nooks first, but they already have an iPhone reader app. The whole thing gets even more interesting when you find out that B&N owns <a href="http://ereader.com">eReader.com</a>, who has a reader for Android. Perhaps they are just in the process or re-branding it or there are some other odd licensing issues keeping them from taking the final step.

But, you can take that step yourself! Download the eReader Android app and install it on your phone (it's not in the Android market). You can then mount your phone via USB to your computer and add your nook ebooks (pdb files) to the ereader directory of your sdcard. The annoying part, well more annoying part, is that when you open the book for the first time you will need to enter the name and credit card information used to purchase it. It's your default card data at B&N. I wonder how bright an idea that is considering I tend to swap out the cards I use from time to time... could get interesting.

Anyway, once you enter your credentials you have full access to the ebook, just like reading it on your nook. I would not be surprised to find out that the ebooks on the two sites are exactly the same. I will have to look into it in more detail.

Happy e-reading!
