As I have delved deeper into the wonderful world of eBook reading I have stumbled upon an interesting dilemma that will eventually plague all of us e-converts... "out of print" books. I am an almost fanatical lover of classic science fiction books, Brunner, Heinlein, Asimov, Van Vogt, Aldiss and others line my bookshelves with weathered and tattered spines and yellowing pages full of exotic stories about other places and times. I love these authors, but they are hard to find, even in used book stores, as most of them have been out of print circulation since the 1970's. So, I have had to comb through used book stores and some on-line sites to get my fix.

But, wait, it's 2010 and eBooks are starting to take hold. Wouldn't it be nice if the copyright holders of these older novels allowed them to be produced as eBooks. I would think that the production costs would be minimal and then once you have it digital, it's all gravy from there. It's not like with a physical book where you have to print them, bind them, ship them and then store them in hopes that there are more people like me out there who want to buy them. No, this would be a win-win situation. Get a nice digital copy and put it up for sale in an e-reader format, via Amazon or Barnes &amp; Noble. With a little publicizing there is no way you can tell me they would not sell enough to make a profit on them. Like I said earlier, these are books and stories that have been out of print and out of circulation for decades. Whole new generations of readers could now download them and enjoy them... as well as other fanatics like myself.

To me it seems that "out of print" should no longer have any meaning. In the digital world, there is no concept of being out of print or unavailable.

I have started toying with the idea of scanning in some of my old copies, for my own digital usage; however, this would be a destructive process as you would have to take the book apart to scan each page. As my old books sit getting more brittle and the pages more yellowed, I start to consider these things more often.

I wonder if anyone makes a double sided scanner.
