In case you haven't noticed, I have added a new static page to this site. The <a href="http://coffeaelectronica.com/blog/software">Software </a>page will be a starting point for a list of my favorite and recommended software. It won't have any reviews, but it will be a general list of what I use and recommend. Reviews will come as I have time and energy for them.

If you are following along, you may have noticed that I have been pretty quiet for a few months. I have been in unemployment mode which tends to mean that I am spending most of my time combing through job sites, working on my "branding", and trying to keep from going crazy being stuck at home. 

I have a few post ideas that I will try to start working on and I hope that my new job will give me some good post ideas as well.

On the Android front... I am trying to get the SDK and development tools all setup on my 64-bit win7 box, but have run into issues. My intended updates to the CoffeaElectronica app are still pending; I may have to setup a virtual linux box or something to get a good environment setup again.

Also, the Wordpress 3 upgrade tweaked my theme settings a bit and I have not been able to figure out how to get my sidebar panels to look right yet.
