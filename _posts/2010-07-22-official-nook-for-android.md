After creating apps for every other platform, BN finally decided to create a full-featured <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/u/nook-for-android/379002287/?">Android app</a> for reading their ebooks (ala nook). I came up with a work-around a few months ago (see <a href="http://coffeaelectronica.com/blog/2010/03/android-nook-reader/">Android Nook Reader</a>) but I never even used it because it was such a pain in the butt.

The BN Nook App works great. It syncs up nicely with your online account and let's you download your books and read them with a number of different fonts and font sizes. It does not seem to sync up your "last read" point as advertised, but maybe I am doing something wrong.

This will be great for when I am waiting around in waiting rooms or want to catch a quick read somewhere without needing to carry the nook itself. Bravo BN!
