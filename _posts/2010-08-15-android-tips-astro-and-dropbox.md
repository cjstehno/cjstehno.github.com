After walking around with a myTouch Android phone for almost a year now, I figured I should share some of my tips.

<br /><strong>Email Attachments</strong>

The default behavior (at least on Android 1.6) for attachments in the Google Mail app is that you can attach photos to an email but no other type of file. Attaching photos is nice, but sometimes you want to send something other than a photo, like a document or music file. The <a href="http://www.appbrain.com/app/com.metago.astro">Astro</a> and <a href="http://www.appbrain.com/app/com.dropbox.android">Dropbox</a> applictions provide some nice additional capabilities, including email attachments: 

<br /><i>Astro</i>

The <a href="http://www.appbrain.com/app/com.metago.astro">Astro</a> file manager app provides a full-fledged file explorer for your Android phone. By installing this app you are also provided with an additional email attachment handler so that when you try and attach a file to your email you have the option of using Astro, which allows you to attach any file. You can also "share" files from Astro directly to create an email with the selected file.

<br /><em>Dropbox</em>

Another alternative is to sign up for <a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> and install the <a href="http://www.appbrain.com/app/com.dropbox.android">Dropbox app</a> which allows you to "share" any file as a link to your dropbox or as an email attachment.

<br /><strong>File Sync-ing</strong>

These apps also add some nice file sync features.

<br /><em>Astro</em>

With Astro you can move files around your phone as you would expect from a file explorer; however, you can also install plugins that allow access to FTP servers, or other computers on your network. I was able to connect to my Networked Attached Storage and transfer files to and from my phone while it was connected to my wireless network.

<br /><em>Dropbox</em>

You can use dropbox to sync files between your phone and your dropbox-enabled computers. the nice part is that dropbox will not pull a file onto your phone unless you tell it to... the downside is that currently it has no built-in way that I have found to delete the local copy of a file while still keeping it in dropbox. I did figure out that you can use Astro to delete the file from the dropbox directory and it will still exist on the dropbox server. if you need it back you can just pull it back down. I have used this trick when I purchased Amazon music on my phone so that I could easily add it to my full collection.

The dropbox app is great for keeping files handy when you need them. while I was doing my job search I was able to keep resumes and other relevant documents available as needed and up to date and easily sharable.
