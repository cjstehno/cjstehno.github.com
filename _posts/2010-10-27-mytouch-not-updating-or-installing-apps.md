After the latest Android Market app update about a week ago I was unable to install or update any apps, which is kind of important. I let it go since the MyTouch Froyo update is in progress; I figured if the Froyo update didn't fix it, I would take action then. It started to annoy me as I had numerous apps to update and no way to do so.

I searched the T-Mobile forums and found one solution that supposedly works... apparently I was not the only one with this problem. The solution was to use the factory reset option which clears out all your apps and updates back to the base install of the Android version you are running on. This seemed a bit extreme but I considered it.

As I was poking around I found that the Market app had a button to "Remove Updates", which only appears when it has been updated (since I can't see it now).

<blockquote>Settings > Applications > Manage Applications > Market</blockquote>

If you press the "Remove Updates" button it will remove the recent Market update and put you back to the vanilla Market app that came with Android 1.6. I figured trying this would be worth a shot since the next step would have been the full reset, which I did not look forward to. I tried removing the updates and was able to use the Market app like before with no issues.

I am still waiting for my Froyo update so I am not sure if the Market app has issues after updating.
