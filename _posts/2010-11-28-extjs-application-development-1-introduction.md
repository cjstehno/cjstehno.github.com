<a href="http://sencha.com/products/js">ExtJS</a> is an awesome JavaScript user interface and application framework developed by <a href="http://sencha.com">Sencha</a> with both commercial and Open Source license options. The one thing I have generally found lacking is their documentation. Don’t get me wrong, their API docs are amazingly helpful, and with a little poking around coupled with trial and error their tutorials and usage documentation are useful, but they often fall short or are out of date. I would like to try and fill in some of the gaps to help bring the learning curve under control.

After working with ExtJS both at home and at work for the past few months, I figured it would be nice to pull together some of what I have found and/or learned to create some good starting point documentation. This was originally going to be a single long blog post; however, as I got into it, I found that I could not really do it justice without breaking it up into a few smaller posts so as to be more digestible to the reader. The examples and discussion here based on my research and use of ExtJS. There may be other ways of doing this, even better ones. If so, feel free to let me know about the better alternatives.

Going forward, I make some general assumptions:
<ul>
	<li>you have a pretty good understanding of JavaScript and some of its more advanced features.</li>
<li>you have poked around the ExtJS API docs.</li>
<li>you have a basic idea of how to instantiate and configure the ExtJS components. If you don’t, you will want to read through some of the <a href="http://dev.sencha.com/deploy/dev/examples/">Samples</a> and their source provided on the Sencha site.</li>
</ul>

The source code used in this article can be found in my GitHub repository at <a href="https://github.com/cjstehno/extjs-demo">extjs-demo</a>. I will tag the ending point of each posting so that you can revert back to the various "save points" as we progress through the demo.

Stay tuned for "ExtJS Application Development 2: Setup"...
