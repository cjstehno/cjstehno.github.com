Welcome to 2011. 

With the start of a new year, I have been thinking about what kind of direction I want to take this blog. Is blogging even relevant any longer? Is there a better way to provide this content in a meaningful and searchable manner? These are things I need to consider going forward. 

I have thought about producing longer format versions or collections of some of my postings in either PDF or epub format, perhaps at a small cost. The original postings would still remain; however, the "published" versions would have more details and deeper investigation into the topic at hand.

I have also added a Donate button to the site. I am trying to cut unnecessary expenses this year, so if the hosting and blogging platform can't start paying for themselves I will have to move them to a free blogging tool. We will see how it goes. 

I have no plans to stop blogging or to take my content down. The worst case scenario would be that I move to a free tool and have to import all my posts (and break the existing urls).

Feel free to post a comment about your thoughts or suggestions about the direction I should take this.

Happy New Year!
