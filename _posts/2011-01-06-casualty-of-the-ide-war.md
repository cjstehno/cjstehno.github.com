Okay, I will admit it... IntelliJ is superior, perhaps even enough to fork over $150/yr to use it... perhaps! Yes, its ends up being about $150 per year since you pay per version and they release about one new version per year. And, no, it's not just the price of doing business. That money comes out of my pocket and there are much more interesting things that I would rather spend it on. You are welcome to donate to my IDE fund (see button to the right). :-)

I hardly do any actual Java development any more. My personal and work projects have all been Groovy/Grails and JavaScript for the past few months, and will be the same going forward. Eclipse is terrible at Groovy and doesn't handle Grails at all unless you use STS, and that is not much better. I have been using NetBeans mostly since it is pretty solid and does an all-around good job; however, I have been giving IntelliJ a real try... and I have to say I am impressed.

I like using one IDE for everything; it really enables you to get best experience, and as those of you who know me should attest, I tend to dig into my software and really become a power user. So, if I am going to move away from Eclipse, it's got to be in a direction that has some potential.

IntelliJ will take some getting used to, and I will have to switch over to it's default key mappings (instead the Eclipse mapping training wheels), but that's all part of the fun.

Eclipse has started to annoy me over the last couple of years. The platform seems to be getting too bloated and there seems to be less focus on core coding and more on new sideline features that most developers may never even get to use.

I have a few more days of my free trial to decide.
