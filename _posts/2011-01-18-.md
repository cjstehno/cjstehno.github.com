Here's an interesting little bastard that I ran into recently doing some Grails work. I am using HSqlDb for my development database and MySql for my production and have had no real issues other than an odd type mismatch for byte arrays. It seemed to be working fine in Hql, but the schema exported to MySql was not making the field large enough to be useful... so I just made a note of it and fixed it with an ALTER statement on MySql since this was my production database (I could afford to come back to it later).

Well, now the issue has come back around during some refactoring. Basically what I am doing is storing uploaded image data as a byte array in a domain object.

<code lang="groovy">
byte[] content
</code>

After some poking around, I found that the generated schema was creating this field as a LONGVARBINARY with no size specified
