I have not been blogging much in the past few months. I do have a few ideas for posts, but I have been spending most of my free time trying to get <a href="https://github.com/cjstehno/MyMdb">My Movie Database</a> up and running. It's still very much an alpha product and it has a long way to go, but it's been great fun working on it. I figured it's about time I shared a screenshot.

It's basically a movie (DVD/BluRay) organizer for people who have too many movies. We have been collecting disks for a long time and even with index boxes it was still very hard to actually find anything you wanted. That's where this project came in. It will hopefully bring some order to chaos... maybe even before the disk formats are obsolete.

If you are interested in the "under the hood details"... its Groovy/Grails with an ExtJS interface, running on Tomcat 6 and MySql in "production".
