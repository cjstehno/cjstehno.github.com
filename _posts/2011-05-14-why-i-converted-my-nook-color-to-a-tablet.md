I won't go into the comparison of the two Nooks, they are really in two different leagues. What I will discuss is my overall thoughts about the Nook Color (all based on the Nook Color after the recent update and app store addition):

<strong>Pros</strong>
<ul>
<li>Browser - the web browser is very nice. Also, since the recent update, it supports flash.</li>
<li>Email - it has a basic, but usable, email client.</li>
<li>Excellent BN eBook support - the integration with BN's online store and the overall reading experience is great</li>
</ul>

<strong>Cons</strong>
<ul>
<li>Moderated App Store - I guess BN hasn't learned from Apple as far as app stores go. Out of the 100-ish apps available, there are maybe two or three that are of any use. I looked at their SDK, and to put an app on the BN app store, you need to modify your app to use their custom Android SDK modifications. I see this as a big roadblock in itself, but BN also says that they want to limit apps to reading-centric content. The bottom line. I will be surprised if their app store gets most of the well-known apps.</li>
<li>Annoyance - page transitions were just jumps before the update, and after are simple page slides. It seems odd when the phone version (same underlying OS) uses a nice page curl effect.</li>
<li>Magazines and Newspapers are horrible. With all the hype BN had put around these, I expected a slick nice-looking ezine experience, when in reality all they are is epubs with no flair at all.</li>
</ul>

Considering all these factors, I decided that I would try to set my Nook free and put a more standard Android version on it. <a href="http://cyanogenmod.com">Cyanogen Mod</a> has support for running <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com/devices/nook-color">Android 2.3 (gingerbread) on the Nook Color</a> so I gave it a shot. It was a bit time consuming, but the actual process was very straight-forward and easy.

I now have a 7in wifi-only tablet running Android 2.3. It has any app I want to install from the marketplace, though there have been a couple that look funky... and of course, the NC has no camera, GPS, or microphone so apps that require those are out. The Nook app works, as does the Kindle, Aldiko and Google books apps. So, really I have turned it into an eReading powerhouse. 

If you want an inexpensive tablet with decent hardware and you don't need all the bells and whistles, this is an interesting option for you. Even if I never use this for much more than book reading... at least I can now read books from anywhere.

If anyone wants to buy a gently used eInk Nook "classic", send me an email.
