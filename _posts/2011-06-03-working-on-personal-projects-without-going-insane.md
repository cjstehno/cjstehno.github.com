As the graveyard that is my <a href="http://github.com/cjstehno">GitHub</a> repository will show, I have had a lot of little projects that went nowhere... and those are just the few that had some useful code. There are just as many which were completely deleted out of frustration or embarrassment over the years. For those of you, like me, who's work and hobby are fortunately or unfortunately the same, there is hope.

The first thing I struggled with was time. I never felt that I had enough time to actually do anything useful on my own time. Honestly, I never realized how much time I used to spend playing games and watching TV or engaged in other less interesting pursuits; it's really amazing how little time it takes to accomplish something. Even an hour or two here and there can make a difference in your project. Just be realistic about it and choose projects and technologies that you are interested in and enjoy working with.

For me it always works best to keep your goals in mind and down to earth. My big project started off as a general need in our household. I literally spent a couple years going around and around on how to implement it in "my limited spare time". Finally, I just gave in and picked some technologies that I felt work be fun and productive and dove in. If you start off trying to write the next big thing, you will get frustrated and probably bail out because that goal is too big and too far off. You can actually use some Agile methodologies at home to break things down into presentable chunks that provide you with a short reward cycle. I have noticed that the longer I have features "in dev" the more I start get get down on the project. It's like it does not feel right and worth it unless I am actually releasing the application on a somewhat regular basis.

I have heard at times that "at home" projects are not really countable as experience since you have no real demands or requirements. I would disagree with that as a blanket statement. Sure, you have a lot more flexibility with your own project, but you still will see the outcome of your decisions good or bad. I have learned quite a bit with my big project, most notably on the use case testing side. I am trying to become a better use case tester, and having to test my own project is actually helping quite a bit. Also, knowing that my wife will be using the app helps... you don't want to give a shoddy app to the missus. It doesn't hurt that I use the same technologies at both work and home as well, since it keeps you sharp.

Sometimes, you will need to step away and take a break. You can go back to games, reading, or other personal activities if you feel that you are stuck on something or need some variety. Just know that your project is waiting for you. It's like how some guys have that old car in the garage that the tinker with every now and then. My car is just made of text and bits.
